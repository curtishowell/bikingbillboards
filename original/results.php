        <h1>Testimonials</h1>
        <br>
        <p>"Biking Billboards took our spring message right to our target audience at local farmers markets. It's a perfect addition to our marketing mix."<br>
          <strong>Jens Molbak, CEO Molbak's Garden and Home</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>"We were blown away by the number of people who said they saw the Verdeaux Condos on the bicycle ads. At each of the venues we watched as almost every person in the vicinity—on foot, on bike or in a car—turned and looked and smiled as the billboard trailers rolled by. It's definitely a cost-effective, high-impact media buy for us."<br>
          <strong>Marty Nelson, Verdeaux Condos</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>"We have had several clients use Biking Billboards to drive traffic to grand openings and events for new home and condominium developments. Not only do they drive traffic to our communities, but our clients can't stop talking about them. They are extremely professional and engaging with the public. It's plug and play marketing and always a hit."<br>
          <strong>Mike West, Marketing Manager John L. Scott / Two Dot Marketing</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>"Biking BillBoards – the new cool outdoor advertising vehicle. It is perfect for northwest businesses that want to bring their message to the masses with high-quality imagery and the chance for 1-to-1 marketing with the right sized hand-out or sample that fits in the cyclists messenger bag. We've used it and are impressed with the results."<br>
          <strong>Jeff Parry, Parry Advertising</strong></p>
